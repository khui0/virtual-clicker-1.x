# Virtual Clicker

Provides a better "clicking" experience in Mr. Lipsky's classes. 

Seat codes are saved, eliminating the need to retype it each time. Keeps track of previous clicks, allowing you to resubmit past clicks or confirm you submitted the correct answer. Quality of life features such as quick access to commonly used math symbols and multiple choice responses speed up class and save valuable class time.

Includes [Periodically](https://github.com/khui0/periodically)'s themes, allowing your experience to be personalized to your liking!
