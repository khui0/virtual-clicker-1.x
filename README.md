# Virtual Clicker
 
GOAL: to provide a better UI/UX for submitting clicks in room 233

Provides a better "clicking" experience in Mr. Lipsky's classes. No longer will you have to type in your seat code each time you need to submit an answer! Also includes quality of life features such as the ability to see and resubmit past clicks

Also includes themes from [Periodically](https://github.com/khui0/periodically) allowing you to personalize your experience
